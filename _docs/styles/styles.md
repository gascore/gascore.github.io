# Styles

In gas templates you can use `<style>` tag.
Values from all `<style>` tags from all `.gas` files composing to one `main.css` file (you can change output file name).

In generated by `gasx new` projects already included sass(scss) support. You only need to install [libsass](http://sass-lang.com/libsass) or [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass)

# Atomic css

Atomic css -- CSS for component-based frameworks. 

For more information about atomic css see [acss.io](https://acss.io/)

All rules and principses in `gasx css acss` was stolen from [acss.io atomizer](https://github.com/acss-io/atomizer)
But there can be little differences:

1. Gasx atomizer use lower case for styles names
2. Aliases names in gasx and acss atomizer may vary

You can found style names aliases by searching in [acss-generate.go](https://github.com/gascore/gasx/blob/master/cmd/compile/css/acss-generate.go)
or in [acss.io list](https://acss.io/reference.html)
